#### Block comments used in the code to record my notes for further development.

## set table limits:

* west/south limits < 0
* east/north limits > 5

Develop move() function to utilise limits(conditionals)

## change facing:

* find current facing within facing array
* add/subtract 1 to index# to turn

**To test the increments to different axis, set 'robotFacing' to new value**
